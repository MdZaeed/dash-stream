Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

This workload achieves an average of 6.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 6.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions.

Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average of 15.19 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.08 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.","local","8.131"
